This is a [ZMK](https://zmk.dev) config repo for my 34/36-keys Chocofi keyboard,
arranged in 3 rows and 5 columns with 3 thumb keys on each side, using
the Canary layout.

The configuration is heavily inspired (although simplyfied) by [Urob](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config)'s keymap.

Some highlights:

- Urob's [timeless
  HRMs](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config#timeless-homerow-mods) configuration
 is used. 
- The most commonly used shortcuts (e.g., copy and paste) are implemented as combos on
